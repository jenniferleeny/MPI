BUILD:
======

Run `make` from the root directory or any subdirectory.

HANDIN:
=======

Ensure writeup.pdf is in the root directory, and then run `make handin` from the root directory. The Makefile is set to automatically clean when generating the handin, but please remove any large output files unaffected by make clean.

CODE:
=====

sqrt3 contains a simple example MPI program that approximates sqrt(3). It is meant to demonstrate the functionality of MPI.

wire_route contains the skeleton code for the assignment. Please implement your code in this directory.

TEST:
=====

Testing will be performed on the latedays cluster. In each directory, run the run_latedays.sh script to launch jobs on the cluster. For example,

`./run_latedays.sh 2 4 inputs/easy_1024.txt stdout_easy_1024_2_4.txt`

will run the wire_route code on 2 nodes (a.k.a. machines) and launch 4 processes for each node. Remember to run 'make' first to generate the wire_route binary.

Example inputs to the wire_route program are in the wire_route/inputs directory. We will test your code using these inputs, and we reserve the right to run additional inputs.

To verify the consistency of the output cost array, please refer to the validate.py script in the wire_route directory. For example if your cost matrix is stored in a file called 'costs_easy_1024.txt_32.txt' and your route is stored in a file called 'output_easy_1024.txt_32.txt', you can run the following command:

'python2 validate.py -r inputs/output_easy_1024.txt_32.txt -c inputs/costs_easy_1024.txt_32.txt'
